# Graph-Creator
A Python 2 script that creates graphs with Matplotlib. Can create Bar, Scatter and Line graphs/charts.

## Does it work?
I don't know, to be honest. Only a tiny bit of testing has been done. Give it a shot and find out. If you make it any better, let me know (I'm @Archergs14 on Twitter).

### Have Fun!
